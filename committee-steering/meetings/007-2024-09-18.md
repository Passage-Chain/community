##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
- Indexer
  - Complete
  - [New requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jiqYcT7Ax_6gtuWXYL5GwbGZnuJWPPflyEVbS9ujtUc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.1l82p8qetnp6) for marketplace UI/UX project
  - Cloudmos will review the requirements and make a proposal
  - Next step will open source the indexer
- NFT Staking Contracts
  - Contracts are done - this is how it works at a high level
    - Vault factory that you can use to create vaults
    - Specify unstaking duration and specific collection that will be locked in the vault
    - After the vault is created, anyone can go stake their NFTs in that vault from the specified collection
    - To unstake, must wait for unstaking duration
    - Admins can attach rewards to the vaults to incentivize staking
    - Every block, users will be able to claim more and more rewards
  - Need to transfer the repo over to Passage-Chain org - will make a request to transfer ownership
  - Does not support CW20, must be IBC, native tokens on Passage Chain
  - Admin interface is a separate repo to transfer over
  - Is this just a mechanism to stake NFTs for rewards, or is this the mechanism to stake NFTs with Eggs for hatching?
    - Set up a token for rewards
  - Can we require people to stake from multiple collections? - Yes
    - Is there a way to specify how many from each collection are required? - Not currently, but can be added
  - Tasio wants to share the initial version so we can review and digest, then determine what else needs to be added or changed
  - Original idea was to stake an egg with a character, and the length of the stake would increase the rarity
- NFT Staking Frontend
  - Can the contracts be shared with James and team so they can begin building out the dashboard?
- Marketplace UI Redesign / Mobile Support
  - Review [Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/design/kbJ1aUj8OzzRdqK74PWFeG/Marketplace-UI)
  - Wireframes in progress
  - Team and Greg have been providing feedback, open to community
  - Once the prototypes are made with teh high-fidelity wireframes, they will create a live UX testing in Maze so community can test
- Marketplace Sales Data
  - Review wireframs in figma
- Airdrop Checker Website
  - Need to discuss mechanics regarding full amount vs. partial amount being staked
  - Need to set some reasonable standards/margins for error
- Open Discussion / Questions / Feedback
  - When are we holding a Steering Committee meeting in Passage?

### Action Items
- Propose airdrop mechanics for scenarios in which Strange Clan NFT holders did not stake the full amount - Passage team
- Post airdrop checker webpage bounty on Github - Bryana
- Transfer NFT staking contracts repo to Passage-Chain - Tasio
- Review Indexer endpoint requirements and propose new budget/bounty for the updates - Max
