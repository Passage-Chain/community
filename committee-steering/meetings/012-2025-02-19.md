##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
- Indexer
  - Indexer is complete
  - Max met with Mike today to handoff
  - Will allow NodeFleet to finish the frontend and unblock other teams
- NFT Staking Front End
  - In Progress
- NFT Collection Launch Interface
  - Ryan and Mike recently met with Jamesâ€™ team
  - Created extensive user flows to ensure everything was accounted for
  - Should be a fairly robust system for letting people create their collections
  - Plan is Passage team will be the first to create collections but eventually will whitelist creators then open up creation to anyone
- Marketplace Front End
  - Should be getting an updated demo link from NodeFleet today to view their progress
- IBC ATOM Payments
  - Ryan and Mike met with Anthony, he asked really good questions, excited to have him working on it
- Passage Chain Upgrade
  - Upgrade needed for Strange Clan airdrop claims process
  - 14-month staking period ends February 28 - after that, need to facilitate the claims process for eligible users
  - Chain upgrade will include airdrop claims as well as general recommended improvements
  - Vitwit has managed the entire airdrop process up to this point, including the airdrop checker website, so has all necessary background
  - Bounty proposal includes managing the governance proposal, upgrade process, and updating the airdrop claims page.

### Open Discussion / Questions / Feedback
- NeoTokyo Event recap
- Potential governance proposals
  - Decrease validator set
    - Passage Chain has 100 validator slots - 98 are active
    - Security concern - less than $400k to buy your way into the bottom 51 validator slots
    - Will support validator sustainability
  - Increase proposal deposit
    - Spam/scam proposals with malicious links have been posted due to low minimum requirement
    - Increasing deposit would deter this
  - Increas gas fee
    - Currently transactions on Passage cost a tiny fraction of a cent
    - Even increasing to $0.01 cent will help prevent transaction spamming while remaining affordable for users
    - Increase prior to upcoming Closed Beta which will bring increased on-chain activity
  - Increase minimum validator commission
    - Minimum is currently 0%
    - Lower commission validators can be more likely to be slashed or miss blocks
    - Validators with a very low (or 0) commission are not cost-efficient/sustainable
    - Proposal to set minimum commission to 5% or 10%
  - Updating team wallets for multisig
    - Current multisig setup includes former team members who are no longer active
    - Proposal to migrate funds to a new multisig that includes active core team members
    - Upgrade would allow team to do this without undelegating
    - Goal is to streamline financial operations and transactions like delegation, bounties, etc.

### Action Items
- Assign chain upgrade bounty
