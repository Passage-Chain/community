##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
- Marketplace Front End
  - Extremely close to being finished
  - Outstanding issue with marketplace fees
    - Should be 3% but is set to 6%
  - Worked with Cloudmos team on indexer issues, was a pretty simple fix once the issue was identified
  - THANK YOU Greg!!
  - Alpha testers are invited to test out the marketplace
    - Yesterday Greg hopped Found some bugs and NodeFleet is already working on fixing those
    - Important to note that this is not a test chain, it’s live on Passage Chain so you will be spending real money when testing
    - Performance will be slow since it’s a test environment
    - Please report bugs that you find! Need individuals to report bugs they’re experiencing
    - Remember - this is alpha, early release and there will be issues
    - If you don’t have the alpha tester role and would like to test the new marketplace, reach out to Greg 
- NFT Staking Front End
  - Focused on UI
  - Done on their end
  - Integration is pending once the new version has been released
  - Need to get testnet up and running so they can test
- NFT Collection Creation Front End
- IBC ATOM Payments
  - Work has been done, just needs to be merged in

### Open Discussion / Questions
- Governance Proposals
  - PASG token burn (proposal #19) is live for voting
  - If passed, will burn all unclaimed/unallocated tokens from Strange Clan airdrop
  - Vote by June 24: https://passage.zenscan.io/proposal.php?id=19
- NFT staking incentives
  - Have been discussing incentives with Metahuahua team, opening this discussion up to the community
  - Rewarding communities who have been holding NFTs or tokens on Passage
  - Would like to discuss the incentives for the first NFT staking initiative (outside of Strange Clan eggs)
  - Opportunity for communities like Metahuahua to stake NFTs for a share in the remaining airdrop pool
