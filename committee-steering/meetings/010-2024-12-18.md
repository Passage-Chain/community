##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
- Indexer
  - Cloudmos continues to make progress and is working with the NodeFleet team so they can begin implementing the new marketplace while the new endpoints are in progress
  - Making modifications to the indexer for traits, which were previously just stored as a JSON object in the database - now there will be a table for it
  - Ecosystem is not stored chain, so they have made it as a config file in the repo. Can edit the file in the repo and it will propagate in the endpoint
  - Aiming to finish all updates in January
- Aidrop Checker
  - Vitwit is almost finished with the airdrop checker site, has made some tweaks over the last week and added new data
  - Community has been testing, the team would like to get a couple more people using it to make sure that it's reflecting accurate before promoting it more broadly
  - Link: [passage.vitwit.com](https://passage.vitwit.com/)
    - Is this the final URL or will it be on the Passage site?
    - Bryana will speak with Mike to get it added to passage.io domain
- NFT Staking
  - CW20 Rewards smart contracts are complete
  - Frontend: 
    - James has been given access to NodeFleet's repo to start familiarizing himself and working on the front end
    - There are limitations for what can be done until NodeFleet is further along  
- Marketplace Front End
  - In progress with NodeFleet
  - Work needed to be done for some of the unique qualities of Passage like ecosystems (mentioned in indexer update)
  - Need the completed indexer to lock in on the timeline, looking at Q1
  - Best case scenario for updating front end is end of January but this may get pushed back depending on when the indexer gets delivered
- Open Proposals
  - NFT Collection Creation Front End
  - IBC ATOM Marketplace Integration

### Open Discussion / Questions / Feedback
- Passage 2025 Outlook
- IBC Monitoring Bot
  - Proposal discussed in last monthâ€™s meeting
  - Consensus was that it wasn't something we necessarily need currently but maybe useful in the future
  - Always open to new ideas for tools that might be useful for the community, validators, marketplace users, etc.

### Action Items
- Provide feedback to submitter for NFT launch interface proposal
