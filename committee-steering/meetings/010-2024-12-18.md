##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
- Indexer
  - Cloudmos continues to make progress and is working with the NodeFleet team so they can begin implementing the new marketplace while the new endpoints are in progress
  - Making modifications to the indexer for traits, which were previously just stored as a JSON object in the database - now there will be a table for it
  - Ecosystem is not stored chain, so they have made it as a config file in the repo. Can edit the file in the repo and it will propagate in the endpoint
  - Aiming to finish all updates in January
- Aidrop Checker
  - Vitwit is almost finished with the airdrop checker site, has made some tweaks over the last week and added new data
  - Community has been testing, the team would like to get a couple more people using it to make sure that it's reflecting accurate before promoting it more broadly
  - Link: [passage.vitwit.com](https://passage.vitwit.com/)

    - Bryana will speak with Mike to get it added to passage.io domain
