##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
- Indexer
  - Cloudmos continues to make progress and is working with the NodeFleet team so they can begin implementing the new marketplace while the new endpoints are in progress
  - Making modifications to the indexer for traits, which were previously just stored as a JSON object in the database - now there will be a table for it
  - Ecosystem is not stored chain, so they have made it as a config file in the repo. Can edit the file in the repo and it will propagate in the endpoint
  - Aiming to finish all updates in January
- Aidrop Checker
  - Vitwit is almost finished with the airdrop checker site, has made some tweaks over the last week and added new data
  - Community has been testing, the team would like to get a couple more people using it to make sure that it's reflecting accurate before promoting it more broadly
  - Link: [passage.vitwit.com](https://passage.vitwit.com/)
    - Is this the final URL or will it be on the Passage site?
    - Bryana will speak with Mike to get it added to passage.io domain
- NFT Staking
  - CW20 Rewards smart contracts are complete
  - Frontend 
    - James has been given access to NodeFleet's repo to start familiarizing himself and working on the front end
    - There are limitations for what can be done until NodeFleet is further along  
- Marketplace Front End
  - In progress with NodeFleet
  - Work needed to be done for some of the unique qualities of Passage like ecosystems (mentioned in indexer update)
  - Need the completed indexer to lock in on the timeline, looking at Q1
  - Best case scenario for updating front end is end of January but this may get pushed back depending on when the indexer gets delivered
- Open Proposals
  - Extending deadline for submissions to January (no specific date yet) 
  - NFT Collection Creation Front End
    - Need to get some feedback to the team that submitted to make sure that all the needs are being met, there might have been a couple couple pieces of clarification that were missing in the scope
    - Want to make sure their proposal is accurate based on the complete scope of work 
  - IBC ATOM Marketplace Integration
    - Received one proposal to review

### Open Discussion / Questions / Feedback
- Passage 2025 Outlook
  - Passage leadership has identified top priorities for the new year, particularly for Q1 and Q2:
    - Increasing Marketplace activity by introducing new collections by external creators
      - Goal is to get more creators to bring NFTs to the Marketplace with a focus on utility within Passage worlds (e.g., avatar assets) - this is the ethos of why Passage Marketplace exists, to deliver utility in Passage worlds
      - Focus on bringing people in who have their own audience that can be added to the Passage community
      - Passage’s 3D team will support creators as needed to design or add utility to their NFTs (for creators who e.g., are not 3D artists)
      - Ability to gate worlds based on NFT collections
      - Delivering on past promises made to the community for Marketplace assets (e.g., astronaut avatars, gold pucks, and eventually Strange Clan pets and mounts that will hatch from eggs via NFT staking)
      - New marketplace frontend will be a huge part of this
    - Closed Beta
      - Targeting Q1
      - New phase that is being introduced on the roadmap
      - Does not change core development priorities but will be an opportunity to bring in Web3-focused users that have more interest in the blockchain elements of the ecosystem 
      - Closed Alpha was geared more toward enterprise users
      - Looking to bring in 100-200 new Web3 users to leverage Passage to create worlds and run events
      - Aiming to synergize the launch of new NFT collections with Closed Beta to inspire more activity on the Marketplace
      - Goal is more events running, more people attending events, allow people to utilize the NFTs they already own, and get new users involved with the token
      - There will be an application process where users will connect their wallet in order to prioritize users who are active in the Passage ecosystem (token holders, stakers) and incentivize new activity
      - Improvements for how people get into events, allowing them to access via their wallet to use their NFT assets
      - Akash integration on frontend so folks can um run their all their events on Akash 
    - Open Beta in late 2025
      - Public release where anybody can sign up and use Passage
      - Options for non-Web3 users to engage with the token for tangible benefits in the platform (e.g, discounted pixel streaming fees with PASG) 
  - Roadmap will be updated
  - Website update in Q1 to provide a more clear pathway to get involved in whatever stage the platform is in (e.g., Closed Beta) and other parts of the ecosystem (e.g., Marketplace, open-source community)
- IBC Monitoring Bot
  - Proposal discussed in last month’s meeting
  - Consensus was that it wasn't something we necessarily need currently but maybe useful in the future
  - Always open to new ideas for tools that might be useful for the community, validators, marketplace users, etc.

### Action Items
- Provide feedback to submitter for NFT launch interface proposal
