## Notes
### Passage Marketplace Proposed 2024 Roadmap
- The highest priority for the marketplace is improving the core user experience. There are a number of areas that do not work correctly or require optimization. We want the marketplace to represent the quality and innovation of the Passage community.
- Core improvements
  - Separate marketplace repo from Passage core repo - WIP
- Indexer
  - Purchased NFTs do not disappear from the marketplace
  - Newly listed NFTs do not appear in the marketplace
  - Users often struggle to see their NFTs in their collection, needing to hard refresh or simply not being able to see them at all
  - Cloudmos has open-source indexer built for Akash - open to extending this to Passage
    - Extension to cover CW721 contract on Passage
    - [Repo for the Cloudmos indexer](https://github.com/akash-network/cloudmos/tree/main/indexer)
    - Tyler (Overclock/Akash) strongly vouches for Cloudmos
  - Questions/Feedback
    - Is it now being managed by the Passage team?
      - Was built to work with Passage Marketplace, but it’s leveraging Subquery
    - Does the project own the actual RPC/API server  infrastructure behind the indexer?
    - This seems like the most important thing we need to work on
    - Do we have enough front-end developers to manage this?
    - Custom indexers are a good way build for specific queries (OmniFlix uses a custom indexer) but using a generic Cosmos SDK + CosmWasm indexer has its own advantages when it comes to network effects and adding more features
    - Will the Indexer be maintained by Passage in the future?
    -   Goal is to offload as to open-source
    -   Passage core team (Mike, Nicholas) can also support
    -   Community-owned
    -   Bounties for specific efforts
    -   NodeFleet is also building an indexer for another project that is similar to Cosmos SDK - interested in supporting
- Assorted fixes - prioritizing usability, driving volume to the marketplace
  - Categories & Sorting
    - Collection list needs to be more obvious
    - Combine the PALS / pucks in 1 collection category (with sub filter choice)
    - Combine world building kits in one category
    - Bring the Strange Clan Series on top in the Collection list, default should be SC t1 for marketplace button + collapsed category list
  - Uniform naming and properties list for SC T1, T2 and Eggs
  - When clicking "back" (previous page) site throws you to SC T2 Kira by default
  - In my collection page, users can’t use the marketplace button or the foldable category button. They can only return with the "All" button
  - Search bar does not work (magnifier button)
  - Add info on seller fees when listing an NFT
  - Feedback from Metahuahua
    - Batch mint
    - Batch Transfers
    - Recent activity (transactions) when selecting an NFT
- Promised initiatives
  - Astro Pucks
  - Golden Pucks
- Upgrades / expanding the feature set: After the existing marketplace experience is solid, we want to expand the feature set
  - Complete NFT staking
  - Auctions and Offers (Front-end, contracts are complete)
  - 3D NFT standards
  - Purchase NFTs in native USDC
  - Allowing people to more easily launch a collection
  - Bids (Primus)
