##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
- Marketplace Front End
  - James has been working with NodeFleet to figure out performance optimizations
    - Effort to migrate to Vite
      - Current version of NextJS was not ideal for performance
    - Looking at upgrading to new version of NextJS
  - Priority is functionality and getting the frontend up first, then performance - but performance will need to be a priority pretty quickly
  - Demo link will eventually be shared with community after this has been worked through
    - Will we give access to the feedback doc or will we filter it first?
    - Can create a thread in Discord alpha-chat or a copy of the doc so NodeFleet isn’t inundated
  - Is it possible that Passage can whitelist the image repository of Deran Fang NFTs so that they load on the demo marketplace?
    - Will look into permissions
- NFT Staking Front End
  - Has been held up by working with NodeFleet on performance optimizations
  - Their team has taken on a lot of the migration efforts
- NFT Collection Creation Front End
  - Has been held up by working with NodeFleet on performance issues
  - Concerned about long-term viability, looking ahead to future-proof their work
- IBC ATOM Marketplace Integration
  - Anthony did some initial work on the old frontend, since then we've had good conversations to make sure he’s working from the correct frontend/repo
  - Has brought up good points re: options for adding support for new currencies in the future
  - Currency will be a fixed option set at the time of collection creation
  - Want NodeFleet to be feature-complete before he goes in and makes the final updates - should not take much time 
- Chain Upgrade
  - Upgrade handler for software upgrade is ready. It includes the updates to cosmwasm, ibc bumps and airdrop claim records. We will tag the release candidate tomorrow for external testing. if anyone interested to test can play around
  - Upgrade handler for multisigs migration is ready for internal testing. We found a couple of missing migrations for this and fixes them today
  - Min-commission upgrade handler is being worked on
  - All these will be separate proposals so we will finalize the release based on the proposal outcomes

### Open Discussion / Questions / Feedback
- Indexer
  - Nicholas looking into issues related to items not showing for sale correctly, will reach out to Cloudmos if it's stemming from the Indexer
- Governance proposals
  - Separate proposals for the following will be going up before the chain upgrade proposal mentioned above - anything that passes will be included in the upgrade
  - Increase gas fee
  - Migrating team wallets to set up new multisig signers
  - Set minimum validator commission to 5%
- Upcoming marketplace collections
  - Focus is assets that will be usable in Passage
  - [Glitch Candies](https://x.com/glitchcandies) character
  - Interchain Labs
    - Working with them on IBC [Eureka/Highway](https://x.com/cosmoshub/status/1897229986706415952) initiative
    - Idea is to take EVM assets and bring that liquidity into IBC assets
  - Working with other creators in Cosmos to iterate and test
  - AADAO avatar assets in ATOM
    - Does accepting other currencies eliminate the need for PASG?
      - 3% marketplace fees will be converted to PASG on the backend
      - Value accrual mechanisms for PASG will stay the same but there is an opportunity to drive liquidity in from more ecosystems which is the idea behind engaging other token
  - Is there any plan to take native coins on chains like ATOM native without IBC or Solana, or will there be some type of interface on the page to facilitate IBC connections? For the average user just IBC itself is a confusing thing
    - The plan would be to integrate a swap or Skip Protocol model which is a really good experience
    - Will be a consistent experience for all assets (ATOM-based, EVM-based)
    - Goal is to make the experience as easy and as native as possible for each ecosystem
- PASG payments in Elite
  - High priority in Q2/Closed Beta
    - First iteration will be paying for streaming points in PASG
    - Later, looking at subscription payments in PASG which is a more involved setup
    - Want to ensure people have a good user experience - For example, wouldn’t want someone to accidentally spend more tokens than expected if there was a dip in the price, would need warnings and notifications
  - Could look at partnering with other teams on this
    - Did Omniflix build something like this?
  - Idea of signing a contract to intermittently pull funds over time for ongoing subscriptions will not appeal to everyone
    - One possible solution is a tokenized pass for subscriptions, so if you purchase X NFT, you have access to that subscription tier for a year
    - Complications in terms of how you handle issues like insufficient funds
    - Same issues happen with traditional web 2/fiat payments like Stripe, but the infrastructure to handle it is more established and straightforward 
- Closed Beta
  - Is there infrastructure for providing feedback?
    - Yes, will likely be a form
  - Closed Alpha users have direct access to the team in Slack
    - Will not be able to scale this level of support so will have some sort of form
    - Anticipating more feature requests than bugs
    - Decreasing core supported maps to mitigate bugs
