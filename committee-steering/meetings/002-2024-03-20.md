- Participants can subscribe to the [Passage Open Source Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/2?cid=Y19iOTYxYTcwMDkzZTQ5ZTYyNDlhYjkxMGRkODUzZjc0NTBkYmRjY2E3YmY1ODdiNmYzNThlMGQ2Njc0Y2RkYzRkQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)
- Regularly standing SIG meetings have not yet been scheduled and will be determined in each group

### Review Community Discussion
- Community tickets mainly revolve around issues related to current indexing solution (e.g., NFTs not showing)
- Pain points are primarily going to be resolved by pushing forward the Indexer, which is the first project priority up for discussion
- No other concerns were voiced

### Projects & Priorities
#### Indexer
- [Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j0aIZ4tZ9feZerXdXK-aJYNIEJoektH_MMvw7kpCj5M/edit?usp=sharing)
   - Does not include API that connects with marketplace frontend
   - Requirements list is pretty basic/simple at the outset
   - Goal is to cover the first section of existing functionality and then build out for future use cases (Covering mints, including USD value of PASG, continual indexing of historical data for price, dashboard for stats, NFT listings/delisting/sales)
- [Indexer Bounty Proposal from Cloudmos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bmmGxj56fGyAmXzN4-lY7gof7XBRlLlsGU_7oBJe-CE/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Addresses all of the requirements along with implementing  an API that will provide this information that anyone can connect to for feeding into the frontend
  - Will be open top other people who want to access this information, for example strangeclanfans
  - Max believes API is essential to the indexer - it’s great to have an indexer itself, but to be able to communicate with that database and expose it to the community members or the marketplace we need an API
  - Spec document listed features like NFT sales, listings, delistings, transfers, but the proposal includes more than that because it was based on the [Passage contracts diagram](https://github.com/envadiv/passage-contracts?tab=readme-ov-file)
  - A lot of these functionalities are not implemented yet or implemented on the contract side but not in the UI, for example auctions or NFT vaults, but these are planned to be implemented because at some point they will be implemented in the UI
  - Cloudmos did an analysis of how to implement all of these
    - Their current indexer solution supports generic Cosmos SDK blockchains and regular transaction types, but it doesn’t support CosmWasm contracts
    - There's a few tricky things that happen with CosmWasm contracts that happens like in block events or transaction events but the ground work done in the current indexer makes this possible
    - There isn’t a blocker they haven’t thought about so it should be done fairly smoothly
  - If there are suggestions or counters to the proposal, Cloudmos is open to discussion (for example, proposed payout terms)
    - Proposed payout: 50% upfront and 50% on completion, 70kUSD of PASG established at the time of the first payment
  - Future-thinking deploy and maintain section - Cloudmos would be able to support for a year, which would be a major assistance to the community
     - The database will be hosted somewhere initially, probably on Cloudmos’ account that they can share with Passage
     - Cloudmos has been running their version of the indexer for Akash for more than two years so it runs pretty smoothly but sometimes if there are additional requests like an extra API end point, that could be in that the maintenance package
   - Tyler says Cloudmos has been a contributor to the Akash ecosystem for years, they follow through and would do the work and be accountable. I would support the team that will go above and beyond. Time is of the essence and Cloudmos is able to deliver something in a timely fashion, that actually works
   - Greg asks: How long until the indexer is fixed (users being able to properly see their NFTs)? All the other stuff is awesome, but the inability to see NFTs properly is currently the biggest issue by a lot (according to tickets).
       - Current proposal is a 2-3 month timeline. Is there an early implementation of this?
       - This may dictate what we potentially do to remedy in the meantime, how can we patch the current indexer while the new implementation is being built 
#### Front end design / Marketplace bugs
#### NFT staking

### Open Discussion / Questions / Comments

### Action Items
- Coordinate members for NFT Staking SIG
- Lex present NFT Staking requirements doc
- Max share updated timeline for initial Indexer feature set
- Bryana set up projects Bounty Board
