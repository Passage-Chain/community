- Regularly standing SIG meetings have not yet been scheduled and will be determined in each group

### Review Community Discussion
- Community tickets mainly revolve around issues related to current indexing solution (e.g., NFTs not showing)
- Pain points are primarily going to be resolved by pushing forward the Indexer, which is the first project priority up for discussion
- No other concerns were voiced

### Projects & Priorities
- Indexer
  - [Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j0aIZ4tZ9feZerXdXK-aJYNIEJoektH_MMvw7kpCj5M/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Does not include API that connects with marketplace frontend
    - Requirements list is pretty basic/simple at the outset
    - Goal is to cover the first section of existing functionality and then build out for future use cases (Covering mints, including USD value of PASG, continual indexing of historical data for price, dashboard for stats, NFT listings/delisting/sales)
  - [Indexer Bounty Proposal from Cloudmos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bmmGxj56fGyAmXzN4-lY7gof7XBRlLlsGU_7oBJe-CE/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Addresses all of the requirements along with implementing  an API that will provide this information that anyone can connect to for feeding into the frontend
    - Will be open top other people who want to access this information, for example strangeclanfans
    - Max believes API is essential to the indexer - itâ€™s great to have an indexer itself, but to be able to communicate with that database and expose it to the community members or the marketplace we need an API
    - Spec document listed features like NFT sales, listings, delistings, transfers, but the proposal includes more than that because it was based on the [Passage contracts diagram](https://github.com/envadiv/passage-contracts?tab=readme-ov-file)
    - A lot of these functionalities are not implemented yet or implemented on the contract side but not in the UI, for example auctions or NFT vaults
- Front end design / Marketplace bugs
- NFT staking

### Open Discussion / Questions / Comments

### Action Items
- Coordinate members for NFT Staking SIG
- Lex present NFT Staking requirements doc
- Max share updated timeline for initial Indexer feature set
- Bryana set up projects Bounty Board
