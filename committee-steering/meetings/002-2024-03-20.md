##  Notes
### Housekeeping
- Steering Committee meetings to take place on the 2nd to last Wednesday of each month at 12:00pm Eastern Time (16:00 UTC)
- Participants can subscribe to the [Passage Open Source Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/2?cid=Y19iOTYxYTcwMDkzZTQ5ZTYyNDlhYjkxMGRkODUzZjc0NTBkYmRjY2E3YmY1ODdiNmYzNThlMGQ2Njc0Y2RkYzRkQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)
- Regularly standing SIG meetings have not yet been scheduled and will be determined in each group

### Review Community Discussion
- Community tickets mainly revolve around issues related to current indexing solution (e.g., NFTs not showing)
- Pain points are primarily going to be resolved by pushing forward the Indexer, which is the first project priority up for discussion
- No other concerns were voiced

### Projects & Priorities
#### Indexer
- [Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j0aIZ4tZ9feZerXdXK-aJYNIEJoektH_MMvw7kpCj5M/edit?usp=sharing)
   - Does not include API that connects with marketplace frontend
   - Requirements list is pretty basic/simple at the outset
   - Goal is to cover the first section of existing functionality and then build out for future use cases (Covering mints, including USD value of PASG, continual indexing of historical data for price, dashboard for stats, NFT listings/delisting/sales)
- [Indexer Bounty Proposal from Cloudmos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bmmGxj56fGyAmXzN4-lY7gof7XBRlLlsGU_7oBJe-CE/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Addresses all of the requirements along with implementing  an API that will provide this information that anyone can connect to for feeding into the frontend
  - Will be open top other people who want to access this information, for example strangeclanfans
  - Max believes API is essential to the indexer - it’s great to have an indexer itself, but to be able to communicate with that database and expose it to the community members or the marketplace we need an API
  - Spec document listed features like NFT sales, listings, delistings, transfers, but the proposal includes more than that because it was based on the [Passage contracts diagram](https://github.com/envadiv/passage-contracts?tab=readme-ov-file)
  - A lot of these functionalities are not implemented yet or implemented on the contract side but not in the UI, for example auctions or NFT vaults, but these are planned to be implemented because at some point they will be implemented in the UI
  - Cloudmos did an analysis of how to implement all of these
    - Their current indexer solution supports generic Cosmos SDK blockchains and regular transaction types, but it doesn’t support CosmWasm contracts
    - There's a few tricky things that happen with CosmWasm contracts that happens like in block events or transaction events but the ground work done in the current indexer makes this possible
    - There isn’t a blocker they haven’t thought about so it should be done fairly smoothly
  - If there are suggestions or counters to the proposal, Cloudmos is open to discussion (for example, proposed payout terms)
    - Proposed payout: 50% upfront and 50% on completion, 70kUSD of PASG established at the time of the first payment
  - Future-thinking deploy and maintain section - Cloudmos would be able to support for a year, which would be a major assistance to the community
     - The database will be hosted somewhere initially, probably on Cloudmos’ account that they can share with Passage
     - Cloudmos has been running their version of the indexer for Akash for more than two years so it runs pretty smoothly but sometimes if there are additional requests like an extra API end point, that could be in that the maintenance package
   - Tyler says Cloudmos has been a contributor to the Akash ecosystem for years, they follow through and would do the work and be accountable. I would support the team that will go above and beyond. Time is of the essence and Cloudmos is able to deliver something in a timely fashion, that actually works
   - Greg asks: How long until the indexer is fixed (users being able to properly see their NFTs)? All the other stuff is awesome, but the inability to see NFTs properly is currently the biggest issue by a lot (according to tickets).
       - Current proposal is a 2-3 month timeline. Is there an early implementation of this?
       - This may dictate what we potentially do to remedy in the meantime. How can we patch/remedy the current indexer in the meantime while the new implementation is being built out?
       - Could we have a provision earlier in the timeline that solves this problem?
       - Need a timeline to be able to give the users because we have a bunch of tickets on it
       - Lex can review with Mike to figure out if there is a reasonable solution to help people in the meantime while the ideal solution is being being developed
       - Max confirms it’s feasible to work in iterations. Can work on a first version that meets the needs of the current marketplace state, then once that is stable they can continue working on the later features
       - This will be iterative and Max can communicate on closer timelines as they get into it
    - Next Steps
      - Implement just a formal proposal. Tyler recommended using a Github project board for bounties
      - We want to get a steering committee vote on it, as it’s the highest priority right now 100%
      - Bryana confirmed that this does not need to be an on-chain vote to go forward with the indexer work, but the team is open to discussion if there are solutions that would make sense
      - Anil and Max confirmed these improvements will not require any chain upgrades

#### Front End Design / Marketplace Bugs
- Nicholas from Passage has been working on this and can share some updates in Discord. It's all happening in the public repo on Github
- He has been picking away at some front-end bugs like the menu for NFT collections being hidden by default, things where it was just not a good user experience, some of the things in the Passage Marketplace roadmap that we had discussed previously 

#### NFT Staking
- Lex will start a document to define requirements of NFT staking and share that in the SIG channel 
- What we have right now is the NFT vault with the parameters that contains the next concrete step that would be really useful for the Strange Clan community particularly, but we want to make this useful for future NFT communities as well
- Do we want to prioritize building a front end for that? We do have development tools for instance for building out/launching a collection but they're not not exposed on the front end, it would all be command line stuff 
- Same thing with NFT staking: do we want to prioritize building out a front end? Need to figure out how people can interact with the NFT vault with their collections and what would be parameters that apply both to the egg staking that the Strange Clan community needs as well as future NFT staking solutions 
- Figure out what's going to be the most valuable for the community that extends to the egg staking solution for Strange Clan but also goes beyond that as a general tool for NFT staking
- Need to form a SIG for NFT staking  - so far, Lex has only spoken with Wolfman from the ohhNFT crew, who's not involved in the open source community yet. Their team has some type of NFT staking solution
- There are some solutions already in Cosmos so theoretically there are people in the space who have some relevant experience but this is something anybody can get involved in on the smart contract level 

#### Other Project Priorities
- Ability to easily onboard new collections to the marketplace is a priority that we haven’t really accounted for right now, wasn't on the roadmap because it is still kind of an open item for discussion 
  - Passage has a set of tools for getting metadata and images up to Pinata or to IPFS and different elements for instantiating the smart contracts on the Passage Marketplace for NFT collections, but they're not exposed on front end in any way - Lex will get more details from Mike, it's in one of the Passage repos
  - This is not quite like what stargaze has with Studio but it would be good to start looking towards a solution that isn't necessarily public but potentially whitelisted so that we can whitelist specific creators and have some type of user-friendly tools for them to use to set up their collection
  - Requirements for this are not yet defined, but it’s something we might like to put together a SIG for so we can discuss what that looks like especially as we're looking to bring more volume and activity to the Marketplace that has the potential to integrate with the Passage platform as well

### Open Discussion / Questions / Comments
- Do SC bounty votes need to be on-chain?
  - Tyler says Akash uses the steering committee to weigh in and that it's not necessary to have a massive vote
  - A lot of folks that are heavily involved in the decision-making process usually join the steering committee calls. If there's any questions, anyone can ask and members of the steering committee would weigh in with their opinions. Max is here to represent the Cloudmos team with the proposal related to the indexer and answer questions
  - If something goes on-chain for a vote, e.g., community pool spend, the SC votes and opinions will be shared with validators, but validators can vote however they want.
  - For bounty votes like this, then whoever is controlling the bounty can move forward as they see fit, as long as the group agrees (in this case, the steering committee)
  - Once it seems we have a general consensus, we can get this up as a project on GitHub 
- Are we prepping the Marketplace for NFTs from other chains, or just adding it to roadmap for future?
  - Could be a future roadmap item and requirement for the indexer
  - It's going to be part of the process of onboarding new creators. If we see a huge synergy or potential with another chain in that process then we can do it
  - We've seen some unique opportunities with Ethereum layer 2s and other Cosmos chains that we've talked about (e.g, having Stargaze outpost on Passage right). There's clear interoperability and interchain opportunities, but we need to figure out the value it would bring to the Passage community
  - A question to ask would be: why shouldn't this be just simply be on the Passage Chain?
  - Especially on the um Passage platform side, we will want people to be able to leverage NFTs from other chains, e.g., Stargaze, Ethereum, to access Passage experiences so it does make sense that there could be an opportunity there on the the marketplace side as well
  - Will address these opportunities as they come up with noteworthy creators
  - The question was meant in the sense that if we got to the point where NFTs could be IBCd from other chains over to Passage, for example if somebody wanted to spin up a Bad Kids metaverse sort of like Huahuaverse. But we could have Passage work straight with the other chains. Since we are working on the indexer, it might be something that in the near term could be planned for since
  - Integrating other chains to natively work with Passage might be a larger ball to tackle 

### Action Items
- Lex create NFT Staking requirements doc
- Coordinate members for NFT Staking SIG
- Max share updated timeline for initial Indexer feature set
- Bryana set up projects Bounty Board
