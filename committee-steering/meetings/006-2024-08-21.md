##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
- Indexer
  - The indexer integration is done! Just got the news a few minutes ago
  - Community can help us jump in and test - we will have the merge to livecode base and communicate when it’s done
- Marketplace UI/UX / Mobile Compatibility
  - Review bounty assignment recommendations
- NFT Staking Contracts
  - Review bounty assignment recommendations
  - Peer Review
    - Team has decided a full audit isn’t needed
    - It's all open source, so it is publicly verifiable which is a helpful catalyst for accountability and security
    - Being able to have a second set of eyes (via peer review) on it and validate it from multiple perspectives is going to be beneficial
- NFT Staking Frontend
  - Review bounty assignment recommendations
  - Egg staking in time for Winter’s Rise events? - Hopeful for the opportunity to have this live by the anniversary of Winter's Rise (Strange Clan community holiday festival and anniversary of the realization of the Egg NFTs)
- Marketplace Sales Data
  - Review bounty assignment recommendations

### Bounty Assignments

  - **NFT Staking Contracts:** Tasio (Uju Labs), $6,000

- No opposing feedback was given on the proposed bounty awards, will move forward

### Passage Platform Updates
- Elite
- Akash Integration

### Open Discussion / Questions
- With the indexer being finished, how will that impact the marketplace? Is everything solved, such as NFTs showing properly in wallets, sales working, and the marketplace listing only NFTs that are currently for sale?

## Action Items
- Assign bounties on [project board](https://github.com/orgs/Passage-Chain/projects/1) and distribute first payments
