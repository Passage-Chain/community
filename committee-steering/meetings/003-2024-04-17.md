##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
#### Indexer
- Bounty update from Cloudmos
  - Moving at a good pace
  - Starting to implement the custom indexer for contracts
  - Waiting on archival node - ETA?
  - Requirements for immediate fixes
    - API to get NFTs
    - Need this to display on the frontend
    - What information do we need for the immediate fix?
    - Sales
    - Mints
    - Listings/Delistings
    - Transfers 
  - Goal: as quickly as we can replace the existing indexer

#### NFT Staking
- [Requirements](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/community/blob/main/sig-nft-staking/nft-staking-req.md)
- [Existing NFT Vault ](https://github.com/envadiv/passage-contracts/tree/main/contracts/nft/nft-vault)
  - This is what the current contract does: you can specify a minimum stake period, an unstaking duration (so once you have reached the minimum stake period if you decide to unstake how long does it take) and then once you stake the NFT it moves the NFT to the Vault contract so it can't be transferred or listed to sell, so it still knows who is the owner of that NFT but it is no longer in possession of the marketplace contract so you're not able to transfer, list, etc.
  - You can unstake, restake during the unstaking phase
  - We have hooks for calling other contracts upon completion of staking, so we can have this contract trigger other contracts for events to happen once somebody has completely unstaked an NFT
- This vault doesn’t provide for pairing NFTs from different contracts/staking 2 NFTs together
  - This is a generic enough concept that other teams will want to use it - being able to stake multiple NFTs from multiple contracts 
- Also would need a staking contract that basically picks which vault to use - this contract would pick which vaults to use based off of the creator input 
  - I think the best way to do this is actually to have the contract emit a a deposited IBC token at a specified rateduring the staking period
- Bounty will be sponsored by Strange Clan via marketplace fees
- Looking for individuals to step up and participate in the SIG for this
  - Reaching out to Tasio who previously worked on smart contracts and the first vault
  - OhhNFT crowd - they have an NFT staking vault, but we’ve had a hard time connecting with them
  - Other recommendations for a bounty that we could set up to make this worthwhile?
- Not only a fun initaitive for Strange Clan community, will also incentivize volume on the marketplace
- Balance of being useful for Strange Clan and other use cases

#### Archive Node
- Blocker for completing the indexer
  - Cloudmous can still work on the indexer in the meantime, but it’s important for historical data
- Potential solutions
  -  [Allnodes](https://www.allnodes.com/) is a potential option
    -  Full node service doesn’t appear to include the archive, need to reach out to them to review options
    -  Could be a sustainable and predictable option 
  -  VitWit interested in hosting, they need to put together a bounty proposal
  -  Other community members can submit proposals for hosting

#### Marketplace Front-End
- Cleanup of the original repository
- Making it more friendly for open-source contributions
- Still relying on existing indexer - new indexer will be important
- Getting to a state where it’s almost ready for anyone to jump in
- Various tweaks (collecting, sorting, etc.)
- Migrating so the deployment will come from the new repository
- Will drop an update next week with what’s new, what’s changed

### Action Items
- Bryana add proposed Marketplace roadmap to Github projects
- Archive node bounty proposal from Vitwit and Allnodes
- Organize NFT Staking SIG
- Lex confirm immediate needs for Indexer fixes
