##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
#### Archive Node
- [Bounty](https://github.com/orgs/Passage-Chain/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=60711767) assigned to NodeFleet 
- NodeFleet has deployed the nodes and provided first snapshot
- First month's payment has been sent
- Will enable Cloudmos to continue work on the Indexer

#### Indexer
- Cloudmos now has access to archive node
- Database architecture is mostly done
- Need old block data to index each of the contract transactions
  - This will be done in the coming week (balancing with travels for Akash Accelerate on May 28 where they will meet the Passage team)
  - They now have this info via archive node, this is the next step for the indexer

#### NFT Staking Contracts
- [Requirements](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/community/blob/main/sig-nft-staking/nft-staking-req.md)
- Tasio has worked on Passage smart contracts in the past
- Question: is this for Juno or Passage chain?
  - Passage Chain - all of the marketplace contracts were migrated over from June over to the Passage Chain
  - Need to ask Mike about the current state of the [the vault contract](https://github.com/envadiv/passage-contracts/tree/main/contracts/nft/nft-vault)
  - CosmWasm environment, shouldn’t be fundamentally different
  - Can coordinate around any elements that might be different structurally
- A lot of this functionality is already available on DAODAO
  - If you launch a DAO you can stake NFTs and there's a staking period, all these things are are very flexible and they have a nice interface
  - Tasio believes they're even working on the token emissions that get paid out like is noted in the NFT staking requirements
  - This is currently only available on Juno, not Passage Chain - Passage had previously gotten a quote for setting up DAODAO on Passage but it $100k
  - Is there a way to adapt what they're doing to the Passage environment or you replicate the methodology?
  - Understand that DAODAO is expensive, maybe this implementation can be a bit more and limited but still flexible enough to accomplish the goals
  - Tasio believes we should eventually do DAODAO based on the functionality they offer - eventually maybe we want people in staking vaults to be able to vote on things, this is what DAODAO is good at
  - DAODAO would be able to deploy this cheaper than Tasio as they already habe the tools available
- Goal for NFT staking is to build something that will facilitate the Strange Clan egg staking event but then also be useful as a general purpose tool
  - For the egg staking, the idea is that we could set up some CW20 token specifically for the event, deposit it into the Vault and then only that token could be used to upgrade the egg
  - Then the same thing could be used for other projects as well, something that was going to be more broad in application so that's the idea but that said there is flexibility in that in terms of how we do that as long It generally fits these these parameters
- The difficulty with this stage of Cosmos infrastructure is it’s cool, but very niche and therefore expensive. The target audience is small enough that supporting the developers who are building it can be really expensive for potential clients
  - DAODAO would take payment in PASG tokens, but this is a huge amount of tokens for the current liquidity
    - We could potentially make this work if it was possible to do it in installments or liquidate the tokens over time
    - Rate at which the chain would recoop those costs in terms of value for the ecosystem - yes, technically would be worth that because no one else can likely do the same thing cheaper, but is it worth it as a value proposition for the chain as an economical entity?  
- Greg: These character NFTs need to be staked paired with eggs and have time requirements for eggs to hatch. Is that available on DAODAO?
  - We do need to be able to pair multiple NFTs - locking up 1 NFT from one contract and another NFT from another contract (1 egg and 1 character)
    - This is a change to the vault we have now or would require a new vault
  - If this isn't something DAODAO already has, this may be a moot point 
  - In terms of time requirements, we are kind of substituting with the token emission concept, although we would want to have a minimum stake. We are pushing for the token emission concept because it's generic enough that you could emit any kind of token that's deposited into the contract and and use that in a way for whatever functionality you need
  - Could be cool to have an NFT that bundles other NFTs. So you have a collection where each NFT owns the other 2 collections (character and egg) and the DAO can be based on staking those bundled NFTs.
    - This would still be something we need to make
- There's also a mechanism that's going to be needed at some point, at least has been discussed, that NFTs would be needed to be staked in order to play the game (Strange Clan) so that might be something to consider as well
  - Basically, we want to have some onchain mechanism for saying you such-and-such identity has a staked NFT - yay or nay - and we could probably accomplish with with any of these
- We should open up a chat for ongoing discussion about this with Tasio and organize a timeline
  - Tasio does a lot of work on CosmWasm NFTs
  - Add Tasio to the NFT Staking SIG
- If this was just specifically NFT staking for an emission of a token then OhhNFT has already set that up and implemented it for free for tons of NFT collections, so there's already functional, affordable currently free option
  - Challenge with this is we have tried to set calls with their team but it's been difficult to coordinate, might not be a reliable longterm path forward
  - Open source, in which case we can just work with what they have
- One of the Zenchainlabs functions has an option for if NFTs are staked somewhere, they can detect that and even do voting power by number of NFTs staked where you can do voting in Discord
  - We are already in discussion with Zenchain on different things
- Do we only need the contracts or also frontend?
  - This is primarily for the contracts, we can get someone else to do the frontend
  - Frontend would probably be faster to have someone who’s not Tasio do this based on his workload
  - Would like to have Tasio focus on contracts
- Next steps
  - Clarify specifications/requirements/scope
    - Compare this to DAODAO integration
  - Need to understand the scope/lift and what it would take Tasio to complete this
- Do we want to get an updated proposal from DAODAO in case something has changed?
  -  Their original proposal for $100k said they are open to getting paid in PASG
    - $100k for the full deployment of all DAO types, which covers maintenance, upgrades, etc. indefinitely
    - $25k per year for membership DAO - for chains that don't need the full suite, need a lighter deployment
      - Maybe this makes sense - need clarification on what the membership DAO vs. all DAO types is
      - Each DAODAO membership type is its own CosmWasm contract. So if we don't need to support every DAO type and make a light frontend it might make sense
  - They are coming out with a feature called staking rewards, which is what was outlined in the spec, token emissions that go to stakers - should also ask about this
    - Would still need a place where our own contracts would interface with DAODAO contracts

#### Other Projects/Priorities
- **Marketplace User Experience Improvements**
  - Indexer is number 1 (currently being worked on) - this is the biggest UX drawback on the marketplace
  - Front-end updates
  - The key is ease of use and adding value/utility to NFTs
    - NFT staking does that so that is a high priority and it aligns with the roadmap of our preeminent project on the marketplace which is Strange Clan, also offers opportunities for other projects

- **Frontend for Creating New Collections**
  - We have a lot of tooling in the command line and in the the backend for setting up new collections
  - If we can set up a front end for that, we can make it easier for projects to to join even if it ends up being a whitelisted process at first
  - Plans to start a launchpad for the marketplace
    - Incentive pool for new collections to launch
    - Submit to receive incentives
    - Ideas being discussed for up-front bonus or guaranteed min
    - Remove risk for launching on Passage Marketplace
    - Rough concept, but goal is to incentivize new creatives on the marketplace as we open up new utility

- **Payments in Other Currencies for Creating New Collections**
  - Priority is being able to accept payments and other currencies
  - For new collections, for people who are listing NFTs or for people who are minting NFTs, allowing them to mint or trade in different currencies
  - First priority would be something like USDC
  - Potentially also accepting highly liquid tokens like ATOM
  - There's a really unique balance because it allows creation of a structure where we can start to build liquidity, build a treasury that is diversified from PASG tokens, and also set up you know some type of system for buying PASG with those tokens
  - There is a benefit to simply having people purchase PASG tokens so that we have more activity which creates in general a better user experience for being able to buy if there's more volume and more interest in the token
  - The benefit of being able to use other tokens is that we can capture that value and control how we are funneling that value into the PASG token in terms of pairing with PASG tokens for liquidity, gives us a more intentional approach
  - This is more a usability thing, not a utility thing, so it’s lower on the priority list compared to e.g., NFT staking or frontend for setting up NFT collections which will directly impact creators on the marketplace
  
This is by no means a definitive list so if there's something you'd like to see on the priorities roadmap for the marketplace, let us know. We want the roadmap to reflect the goals and needs of the community.

- **Passage Platform Updates**
  - Finishing PALs avatar system is a priority so NFTs have utility within the Passage application for customizations
  - Final testing on Passage Elite v0, although separate from the open source initiative it is going to be a really great opportunity to get world creators building
  - Goal is to get them using the chain for whatever their needs might be
  - Starting onboarding first participants that are all committed and span different genres of experience
  - v1 is the next version, purposely leaving that slate very blank so we can add stuff based on user feedback, some of which might be more appropriate as open source initiatives
  - One thing we know we want in v1 is NFT gating and NFT integration, kind of like two forks off of one initial set of work
    - Initial set of work is access to the indexer and allowing us to do [blank] based on NFT ownership
    - Two of the obvious first integrations of that will be NFT gating ownership to enter an experience and PALs
    - We're excited about what that means for participation in the marketplace from a consumer perspective but also from a creative perspective
  - Initial set of work is access to the indexer and allowing us to do [blank] based on NFT ownership and
  - Recently discussed the idea of a launchpad / incentive program for the marketplace
    - We like the idea of quality control but opening it up and allowing people to participate and making sure that they know if they participate they are getting compensated
    - We want to leave that a little open for now so we can figure out what best way to get the most talented kind of creators involved but we think that'll be a really big benefit to the chain and and the open source community
    - Setting a time to begin pulling in artists actively rather than passively, really put the word out and get some of the best creating in this space
    - Launchpad idea would likely happen around the time of Passage Elite v2, which is when Elite will be publicly available to just sign up and start using
    - When we bring in artists to sell assets and and and make that commitment and do that work we want to make sure the people they're selling to have many options including creating their own world 
  - Initial set of Elite users is small, will to be ramping that up fairly quickly
  - A lot of people in the queue to join Passage Elite are largely Web3 focused initiatives with the goal of creating a space for a specific user set to consistently join
  - We want to make sure there's also groups that are creating experiences meant for anybody to jump into, which means that anybody can try out their assets and participate in those events
  - The Integrations being added to Elite to leverage the marketplace in different ways will hopefully have a benefit and vice-versa, Elite also benefits hugely from the pool of users and the ability to gate things based on that 




### Open Discussion / Questions / Feedback
- At some point do we need to talk about the initiative to get the T1 NFTs onchain that were not claimed back on Juno chain?  We have some tickets open from a few purchasers.
  - This will follow from the Indexer completion
- Link to Kado on the marketplace and get PASG purchasable right through Kado
  - Would want to ensure we are getting the best possible UX
  - Greg has been in touch with their team
  - There could be potential even for promotions like they've done in the past for OSMO and ATOM - competitions for the most purchases of a specific coin
  - Passage has had a chat with Kado in the past, need to circle back on the details
  - Kado or a fiat onramp will be more useful as other roadblocks are removed like building PASG liquidity
  - Building out a structure where people can pay via Stripe for things on the Passage platform, and us purchase PASG on the backend


### Action Items
- Reach out to DAODAO for updated info/proposal re: NFT Staking - Lex Avellino
- NFT staking scope discussion - Tasio via SIG chat
