##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
#### Archive Node
- [Bounty](https://github.com/orgs/Passage-Chain/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=60711767) assigned to NodeFleet 
- NodeFleet has deployed the nodes and provided first snapshot
- First month's payment has been sent
- Will enable Cloudmos to continue work on the Indexer

#### Indexer
- Cloudmos now has access to archive node
- Database architecture is mostly done
- Need old block data to index each of the contract transactions
  - This will be done in the coming week (balancing with travels for Akash Accelerate on May 28 where they will meet the Passage team))
  - They now have this via archive node, this is the next step for the indexer

#### NFT Staking Contracts
- [Requirements](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/community/blob/main/sig-nft-staking/nft-staking-req.md)
- Tasio has worked on Passage smart contracts in the past
- Question: is this for Juno or Passage chain?
  - Passage Chain - all of the marketplace contracts were migrated over from June over to the Passage Chain
  - Need to ask Mike about the current state of the [the vault contract](https://github.com/envadiv/passage-contracts/tree/main/contracts/nft/nft-vault)
  - CosmWasm environment, shouldn’t be fundamentally different
  - Can coordinate around any elements that might be different structurally
- A lot of this functionality is already available on DAODAO
  - If you launch a DAO you can stake NFTs and there's a staking period, all these things are are very flexible and they have a nice interface
  - Tasio believes they're even working on the token emissions that get paid out like is noted in the NFT staking requirements
  - This is currently only available on Juno, not Passage Chain - Passage had previously gotten a quote for setting up DAODAO on Passage but it was very high
    - $100k one-time payment for all DAOs and ongoing support
    - $25k per year for membership DAO
      - Each DAODAO membership type is its own CowmWasm contract. So if we don't need to support every DAO type and make a light frontend it might make sense
  - Is there a way to adapt what they're doing to the Passage environment or you replicate the methodology?
  - Understand that DAODAO is expensive, maybe this implementation can be a bit more and limited but still flexible enough to accomplish the goals
  - Tasio believes we should eventually do DAODAO based on the functionality they offer - eventually maybe we want people in staking vaults to be able to vote on things, his is what DAODAO is good at
  - DAODAO would be able to deploy this cheaper than Tasio as they already habe the tools available
  - DAODAO is coming out with a feature called staking rewards
- Goal for NFT staking is to build something that will facilitate the Strange Clan egg staking event but then also be useful as a general purpose tool
  - For the egg staking, the idea is that we could set up some CW20 token specifically for the event, deposit it into the Vault and then only that token could be used to upgrade the egg
  - Then the same thing could be used for other projects as well, something that was going to be more broad in application so that's the idea but that said there is flexibility in that in terms of how we do that as long It generally fits these these parameters
- The difficulty with this stage of Cosmos infrastructure is it’s cool, but very niche and therefore expensive. The target audience is small enough that supporting the developers who are building it can be really expensive for potential clients
  - DAODAO would take payment in PASG tokens, but this is a huge amount of tokens for the current liquidity
    - We could potentially make this work if it was possible to do it in installments or liquidate the tokens over time
    - Rate at which the chain would recoop those costs in terms of value for the ecosystem - yes, technically would be worth that because no one else can likely do the same thing cheaper, but is it worth it as a value proposition for the chain as an economical entity?  
- Greg: These character NFTs need to be staked paired with eggs and have time requirements for eggs to hatch. Is that available on DAODAO?
  - We do need to be able to pair multiple NFTs - locking up 1 NFT from one contract and another NFT from another contract (1 egg and 1 character)
    - This is a change to the vault we have now or would require a new vault
  - If this isn't something DAODAO already has, this may be a moot point 
  - In terms of time requirements, we are kind of substituting with the token emission concept, although we would want to have a minimum stake. We are pushing for the token emission concept because it's generic enough that you could emit any kind of token that's deposited into the contract and and use that in a way for whatever functionality you need
  - Could be cool to have an NFT that bundles other NFTs. So you have a collection where each NFT owns the other 2 collections (character and egg) and the DAO can be based on staking those bundled NFTs.
    - This would still be something we need to make
- There's also a mechanism that's going to be needed at some point, at least has been discussed, that NFTs would be needed to be staked in order to play the game (Strange Clan) so that might be something to consider as well
  - Basically, we want to have some onchain mechanism for saying you such-and-such identity has a staked NFT - yay or nay - and we could probably accomplish with with any of these
- We should open up a thread for ongoing discussion about this with Tasio and organize a timeline 
- Zenchain also has voting per NFT ownership in discord.
- For NFT staking frontend, it would be faster to have someone who’s not Tasio do this based on his workload



#### Other Projects/Priorities
- Marketplace Front-End for Creating New Collections
- Payments in Other Currencies for Creating New Collections

### Open Discussion / Questions / Feedback
- At some point do we need to talk about the initiative to get the T1 NFTs onchain that were not claimed back on Juno chain?  We have some tickets open from a few purchasers.
  - This will follow from the Indexer completion
- Greg would like a link to Kado on the marketplace and get PASG purchasable right through Kado
  - Would want to ensure getting the best possible UX

### Action Items
- Reach out to DAODAO for updated info/proposal re: NFT Staking - Lex Avellino
- NFT staking scope discussion - Tasio via SIG chat
