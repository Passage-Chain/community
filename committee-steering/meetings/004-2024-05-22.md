##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
#### Archive Node
- [Bounty](https://github.com/orgs/Passage-Chain/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=60711767) assigned to NodeFleet 
- NodeFleet has deployed the nodes and provided first snapshot
- First month's payment has been sent
- Will enable Cloudmos to continue work on the Indexer

#### Indexer
- Cloudmos now has access to archive node
- Database architecture is mostly done
- Cloudmos needs old block data to index each of the contract transactions
  - This will be done in the coming week (balancing with travels for Akash Accelerate on May 28)
  - They now have this via archive node

#### NFT Staking
- [Requirements](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/community/blob/main/sig-nft-staking/nft-staking-req.md)
- Tasio has worked on Passage smart contracts in the past
- Question: is this for Juno or Passage chain?
  - Passage Chain - all of the marketplace contracts were migrated over from June over to the Passage chain
  - Need to ask Mike about the current state of the [the vault contract](https://github.com/envadiv/passage-contracts/tree/main/contracts/nft/nft-vault)
  - CosmWasm environment, shouldnâ€™t be fundamentally different
  - Can coordinate around any elements that might be different structurally
- DAODAO
  - A lot of this functionality is already available on DAODAO
  - If you launch a DAO you can stake NFTs and there's a staking period, all these things are are very flexible and they have a nice interface
  - Tasio believes they're even working on the token emissions that get paid out like is noted in the NFT staking requirements
  - This is only available on Juno, not Passage Chain
  - We had previously gotten a quote for setting up DAODAO on Passage but it was very high ($100k)
  - Is there a way to adapt what they're doing to the Passage environment or you replicate the methodology?
  - Greg: These character NFTs need to be staked paired with eggs and have time requirements for eggs to hatch. Is that available on DAODAO?
    - Pushing for the token emission concept because it's generic enough that you could emit any kind of token that's deposited into the contract and and use that in a way for whatever functionality you need 
  - Each DAO DAO membership type is it's own CowmWasm contract. So if you don't need to support every DAO type and make a light frontend it makes some sense
- Goal for NFT staking is to build something that will facilitate the Strange Clan egg staking event but then also be useful as a general purpose tool
- Maybe this implementation can be a bit more and limited but still flexible enough to accomplish the goals 




#### Other Projects/Priorities
- Marketplace Front-End for Creating New Collections
- Payments in Other Currencies for Creating New Collections

### Open Discussion / Questions / Feedback
- At some point do we need to talk about the initiative to get the T1 NFTs onchain that were not claimed back on Juno chain?  We have some tickets open from a few purchasers.
  - This will follow from the Indexer completion
- Greg would like a link to Kado on the marketplace and get PASG purchasable right through Kado
  - Would want to ensure getting the best possible UX

### Action Items
- Reach out to DAODAO for updated info/proposal re: NFT Staking - Lex Avellino
- NFT staking scope discussion - Tasio via SIG chat
