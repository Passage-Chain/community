##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
- Indexer
  - Almost done, expected to release it this week or next week at the latest. If we meet this timeline, Passage Q1 roadmap goals should be on track
  - Having this complete will free up the NodeFleet team to make progress on the frontend, which in turn will remove blockers for NFT staking and eventually IBC ATOM payments and NFT collection interface
  - Main changes were to support the new functionalities of the updated Marketplace being worked on by NodeFleet
  - In the first version, traits were not being indexed, so those were added along with a few requested end points
  - Improvements for performance and scalability
  - Details can be viewed in the [indexer repo](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/indexer)
- NFT Staking Front End
- Marketplace Front End
- Proposals
  - NFT Collection Creation Front End
  - IBC ATOM Marketplace Integration

### Open Discussion / Questions / Feedback
- Endpoint Monitoring Service
- Passage Explorer
- Passage platform updates
  - Collaboration with [MIT Reality Hack](https://www.mitrealityhack.com/) experiential hackathon going live this week Thursday
  - Rerecreated the MIT campus in Passage

### Action Items
- Assign bounties for IBC ATOM payments and NFT collection launcher once updated proposals are received
