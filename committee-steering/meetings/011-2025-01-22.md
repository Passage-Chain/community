##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
- Indexer
  - Almost done, expected to release it this week or next week at the latest. If we meet this timeline, Passage Q1 roadmap goals should be on track
  - Having this complete will free up the NodeFleet team to make progress on the frontend, which in turn will remove blockers for NFT staking and eventually IBC ATOM payments and NFT collection interface
  - Main changes were to support the new functionalities of the updated Marketplace being worked on by NodeFleet
  - In the first version, traits were not being indexed, so those were added along with a few requested end points
  - Improvements for performance and scalability
  - Details can be viewed in the [indexer repo](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/indexer)
- NFT Staking Front End
  - Finishing up the UI and the admin dashboard based on the new contracts Tasio provided
  - Indexer is the major blocker for integration 
- Marketplace Front End
  - NodeFleet continues work on the front end 
- Proposals
  - NFT Collection Creation Front End
    - Proposal from James’ team who is working in NFT staking frontend
  - IBC ATOM Marketplace Integration
  - NFT Collection Creation Front End
    - Proposals from someone who has worked on the Talis marketplace as well as one other team
  - Passage team has spoken with the teams who submitted proposals for both bounties and are going through the process of answering questions back and forth to make sure everyone is aligned on requirements, scope, and objectives
  - Will be getting revised proposals submitted which will include final proposed timelines and budgets for approval

### Open Discussion / Questions / Feedback
- Endpoint Monitoring Service (Cosmonaut Stakes)
  - Cosmonaut Stakes took the initial idea of an endpoint monitoring bot (discussed during last month’s meeting) and decided to instead create a dashboard which presents the data the bot aggregates in the back end
  - Also gives the option for anyone to use the actual bot itself
  - Example dashboards: [analytics.cosmonautstakes.com](https://analytics.cosmonautstakes.com/)
  - Endpoints are from the Cosmos Chain registry
    - If Passage decided to also implement Discord, there would also be commands to add custom endpoints so if someone has an endpoint that's not on the Cosmos Chain registry
  - View endpoint statistics, health metrics, average response time, performance
    - Calls are made every 5 minutes or or less
  - Can subscribe to your own endpoint or other endpoints, so if it ever goes down you’ll receive a notification and downtime threshold is configurable
  - Cosmonaut Stakes is working on implementing more of the bots into the dashboard - for example, IBC stuck packets
  - Thoughts on this from other validators?
    - Primus - ZenChainLabs uses their own RPC endpoints, thinks it is a great tool for monitoring
    - Greg - could see use for different validators although he has his own monitoring in place 
    - For Passage Chain, there are some validators that are newer or only validate on Passage, so could see it being beneficial to them
  - What would a validator do if an IBC transaction got stuck if we got an alert on?
    - In that case it's for just for relays and for e.g., the Passage team so they could ping the relay in question that's responsible for relaying on the certain path
    - Example scenario with Secret Network - they have a Telegram group and if there are some stuck packets the group is notified to take action
  - Could use the Discord validator status channel for alerting  - Discord Bot allows for anyone to add their tags to a certain path that they relay on and receive notifications
  - Requesting delegation from the foundation rather than a bounty
- Passage Explorer
  - Mintscan [discontinuing support](https://x.com/passageio/status/1877020668031570421) for Passage Chain as of January 31 after change in Cosmostation leadership team and business model
  - Working with Primus from ZenChainLabs to customize their existing explorer [passage.zenscan.io](https://passage.zenscan.io/)
  - Seeking feedback on which features the community would find useful for validators, PASG holders, etc.
  - Primus has been a longtime community participant and has been running ZenScan for awhile, made some quick visual changes to update the branding
  - Passage team is working on a list of required changes and features but want to ensure the community has input
  - Initial scope of project is direct collaboration with the Passage team, but future open-source bounties could be issued for bigger features requested by community
- Passage platform updates
  - Collaboration with [MIT Reality Hack](https://www.mitrealityhack.com/) experiential hackathon going live this week Thursday
  - Rerecreated the MIT campus in Passage

### Action Items
- Assign bounties for IBC ATOM payments and NFT collection launcher once updated proposals are received
