##  Notes
### Passage Platform Roadmap
- PALS (Personal Avatar and Likeness System) - free avatar customizations
- Single-link entry with queueing system
  - Needed for NFT access to avoid double gating
- Paid avatar customizations will follow once single link entry is in place
- Preparing for an event in January with MIT's Reality Hack event will benefit from these features
- Finishing frontend for Akash so it’s available for everyone to run events on Akash

### Projects & Priorities
- Indexer
  - Complete but some changes/endpoints needed for new marketplace projects
  - Graph QL Service
    - Lowell from NodeFleet and Max from Cloudmos met in person at Cosmoverse to discuss new requirements
    - Possible that NodeFleet will do a backend extension or Cloudmos will finish what's needed
    - Will confirm next steps after travels 

- NFT Staking Contracts
  - Tassio completed smart contracts for NFT staking
    - Updated with [ability to set start time](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/admin-staking-site/commit/1129aed4cfe27899d018659ac420df88361e142b) in the admin interface
  - New [bounty proposal from Tasio for CW20 token rewards](https://github.com/orgs/Passage-Chain/projects/1/views/1?pane=issue&itemId=84905391&issue=Passage-Chain%7Cnft-staking%7C1)
    - Was in original requirements discussed for NFT staking, but didn’t make it into the final proposal request
    - Will allow flexibility for creators to offer rewards with different tokens
    - Passage team would recommend approving this 
  - Smart Contract Peer Review
    - Completed by KodeSage's team - [View the Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krpS1ho3IpGm2tiImiUnGpRf6fBWHbxto5ukXUpSNA4/edit?tab=t.0)
    - Detailed report, will have Tasio review and address any issues

- NFT Staking Frontend
  - James and team have produced a prototype and designs:
    - [UI/UX Designs](https://www.figma.com/design/HsWqddrC1lx1gK4vme0HJx/Passage-Vault?node-id=377-1424&node-type=canvas&t=VoR0F4BCjxnwTcCG-0 )
    - [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/HsWqddrC1lx1gK4vme0HJx/Passage-Vault?node-id=381-5406&node-type=canvas&t=0AlBelyNB73756gW-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=377%3A1424&starting-point-node-id=381%3A5406)
  - Goes hand-in-hand with the UI/UX and frontend work NodeFleet is doing for the marketplace
    - Teams have had to collaborate to reconcile some of their designs to match
  - Design phase is ongoing
    - Open to feedback and review by anyone on the committee
    - Greg has already been reviewing

    - Similar timelines and budgets
