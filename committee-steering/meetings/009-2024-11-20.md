##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
- Indexer
  - [New requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vdeGdl6ZD60ciaeoZ5Z_RQ1HzTv882oISao8IC_oAA8/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0) from NodeFleet
    - Max and Lowell met in person and have been discussing solution, are now aligned on new requirements
    - Missing end points and some improvements
    - Adding sorting and filter options
  - Cloudmos [proposal](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/indexer/issues/1#issuecomment-2484569364)
    - Would like to move this forward soon, it’s a blocker for NodeFleet’s active projects
    - Estimated timline is 1-2 months
    - Passage core team recommends approving and assigning the bounty to Cloudmos
- NFT Staking
  - [CW20 Rewards](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/nft-staking/issues/1) 
    - Tasio has had some delays due to personal things
    - It’s on the top of his priority list, will be working on it in the coming week
    - Looking to wrap up the CW20 functionality and patch the contract with some of the findings from the peer review
  - [Frontend](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/community/issues/4)
    - James continues working on the frontend but has requested access to the repo
    - Nodefleet can get him access
  - Smart Contracts
    - Bonus bounty issued for [peer review](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/community/issues/7) - no truly critical issues were found, but the [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krpS1ho3IpGm2tiImiUnGpRf6fBWHbxto5ukXUpSNA4/edit?tab=t.0) was very thorough and Tasio will be making some minor changes to the contract
- Marketplace UI/UX & Sales Data
  - NodeFleet continues to work on the frontend like mockups
  - Can still advance the project even without the new endpoints until a point, need the data to display properly all the information the marketplace will have
  - In the meantime, moving forward with the designs that were approved after the UX test that
  - Would be beneficial for their team to meet with Ryan on the product side to review progress and get direct feedback
    - They can send the Maze link and the link where changes are being made in realtime
  - [Demo site](https://passage-zone.netlify.app/) has not been updated since last meeting, waiting to finish some things to upload
  - Plan to upload the new version of the demo by end of week
- [Airdrop Checker Website](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/community/issues/8)
  - Started indexing staking history of all the air drop accounts, expecting to have the data ready by early next week
  - In the meantime, want to have the interface checker website ready with some dummy data for anyone to play around with
  - By end of next week should have some working website ready
  - Will begin testing the next week
  - Can they share the figma designs with the committee?
  - Question for Max: Can you query staking history of an account with the current indexer?
    - Yes, you can query the list of the transaction for staking or unstaking for an address
    - There is not a custom API for staking but Max can pull the data pretty quickly, will take a bit more effort if Anil wants to query it himself
    - Max and Anil connect async on this and think about how they would like to query the data, either directly on the database or through the custom API point
- New Bounty: NFT Collection Launch Interface
- New Bounty: ATOM Payments

### Open Discussion / Questions / Feedback
- [IBC Status Monitoring Bot](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jjcp6JDCIXwH_pFdm56W5pDpSe7TGvBXj0Dsjy6a4zw/edit?tab=t.0)
  - Dan from Cosmonauts Stakes has presented the idea to Passage validators for an IBC monitoring Discord bot that can be added to the Passage server
    - 
  - Has this been built for any other projects yet?
    - There is one instance running on their own [test server](https://discord.gg/7EPwb6Wk)
    - Currently in talks with Akash to create this for their server
  - What’s the difference between this tool and using Grafana with Blackbox?
