##  Notes
### Projects & Priorities
- Indexer
  - [New requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vdeGdl6ZD60ciaeoZ5Z_RQ1HzTv882oISao8IC_oAA8/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0) from NodeFleet
    - Max and Lowell met in person and have been discussing solution, are now aligned on new requirements
    - Missing end points and some improvements
    - Adding sorting and filter options
  - Cloudmos [proposal](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/indexer/issues/1#issuecomment-2484569364)
    - Would like to move this forward soon, it’s a blocker for NodeFleet’s active projects
    - Estimated timline is 1-2 months
    - Passage core team recommends approving and assigning the bounty to Cloudmos
- NFT Staking
  - [CW20 Rewards](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/nft-staking/issues/1) 
    - Tasio has had some delays due to personal things
    - It’s on the top of his priority list, will be working on it in the coming week
    - Looking to wrap up the CW20 functionality and patch the contract with some of the findings from the peer review
  - [Frontend](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/community/issues/4)
    - James continues working on the frontend but has requested access to the repo
    - Nodefleet can get him access
  - Smart Contracts
    - Bonus bounty issued for [peer review](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/community/issues/7) - no truly critical issues were found, but the [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1krpS1ho3IpGm2tiImiUnGpRf6fBWHbxto5ukXUpSNA4/edit?tab=t.0) was very thorough and Tasio will be making some minor changes to the contract
- Marketplace UI/UX & Sales Data
  - NodeFleet continues to work on the frontend like mockups
  - Can still advance the project even without the new endpoints until a point, need the data to display properly all the information the marketplace will have
  - In the meantime, moving forward with the designs that were approved after the UX test that
  - Would be beneficial for their team to meet with Ryan on the product side to review progress and get direct feedback
    - They can send the Maze link and the link where changes are being made in realtime
  - [Demo site](https://passage-zone.netlify.app/) has not been updated since last meeting, waiting to finish some things to upload
  - Plan to upload the new version of the demo by end of week
- [Airdrop Checker Website](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/community/issues/8)
  - Started indexing staking history of all the air drop accounts, expecting to have the data ready by early next week
  - In the meantime, want to have the interface checker website ready with some dummy data for anyone to play around with
  - By end of next week should have some working website ready
  - Will begin testing the next week
  - Can they share the figma designs with the committee?
  - Question for Max: Can you query staking history of an account with the current indexer?
    - Yes, you can query the list of the transaction for staking or unstaking for an address
    - There is not a custom API for staking but Max can pull the data pretty quickly, will take a bit more effort if Anil wants to query it himself
    - Max and Anil connect async on this and think about how they would like to query the data, either directly on the database or through the custom API point
- New Bounty: NFT Collection Launch Interface
  - Planning for December 11 due date for proposals but can be flexible and answer any questions people have as they review the requirements
- New Bounty: ATOM Payments
  - Finalizing requirements, will post in the next few days
  - Related to Passage collaboration with AADAO
  - Simpler integration - when creating a collection, you will be able to select ATOM or PASG as the currency that collection is transacted in
  - This will be defined at the collection level - both currencies will not be available as options for users when purchasing NFTs #
  - Passage [smart contracts](https://github.com/Passage-Chain/contracts) already allow for specifying the currency, so in this case it'll be either PASG or IBC ATOM (not native ATOM)
  - Mostly front-end work to make the marketplace smart enough to read from the smart contract what denomination it should be showing as well as ensuring that when somebody interacts with one of the smart contracts, it's interacting in the right currency
  - On the back end, we'll need to update some existing end points to handle multiple denominations
  - General testing and quality assurance
  - Anticipating due date of December 11 for proposals

### Open Discussion / Questions / Feedback
- [IBC Status Monitoring Bot](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jjcp6JDCIXwH_pFdm56W5pDpSe7TGvBXj0Dsjy6a4zw/edit?tab=t.0)
  - Dan from Cosmonaut Stakes has presented the idea to Passage validators for an IBC monitoring bot for the Passage Discord server
  - Two types of alerts
    - Stuck commitment packets that need to be relayed (for example, would receive a Discord notification when a packet stays there without being relayed for e.g., 30 minutes)
    - Expiring client connections (for example, if there are 14 days left in the connection and it's about to expire then there will be a notification sent on Discord)
  - Commands used to receive notifications in Discord
  - Could be useful in the future but maybe right now because there's not much IBC traffic, maybe once there are more paths open
  - How common is it for these issues to pop up with relays?
    - It depends - for example for Passage/Osmosis it’s probably not an issue because it’s one of the most used paths but for connections which are less covered by relayers or less utilized, it could be an issue
    - Rule of thumb is if a path is covered by three or more relayers or more, it's less likely for all of them to be offline at the same time
    - If you have only one or two, then the probability of one or both going down and there being nobody else to take care of those packets, then the user experience will suffer
  - If we get an alert in Discord about there being an issue, what do we do in response to that? Do the relayers know enough to be able to fix it, or is this specific to a relayer would have to go on their own server to fix it?
    - It's just a way to let relayers know hey something's wrong, you need to take action and see what's wrong
  - Some relayers are more reliable than others and maybe there's no no need for such a tool but for paths are less used/covered then this can be an issue
  - Has this been built for any other projects yet?
    - There is one instance running on their own [test server](https://discord.gg/7EPwb6Wk)
    - Currently in talks with Akash to create this for their server
  - A nice tool to have to ensure there’s always at least one relayer that's taking care of packets on certain IBC paths
  - What’s the difference between this tool and using Grafana with Blackbox?
    - Grafana with Blackbox lets you create rules for requesting in an iterative way against one IP or against a pin or HTTP request
    - Usually Grafana has integrations with Discord bots
    - NodeFleet has 50 different blockchain nodes and has a Discord bot which pings their team every time one of them goes down or something happens
    - Blackbox rules can be modified - maybe this is something that could be added to the existing bot
    - Is the bot doing anything more chain specific apart from just checking when a service is up or down?
      - Dan would need to look into this more since he's never heard of Blackbox - Lowell can send him more information
      - Blackbox lets you (via Grafana) create rules for monitoring e.g., every x amount of time, specific IPs, specific pings, specific calls, and if those calls don't happen you can retry three or four or five times. If it doesn't happen from there, it can send an alarm with goes through a Discord bot or email or SMS
      - It’s a more complete solution because it's made for devops and infrastructure but maybe some of the tooling and features could be used for the IBC monitoring bot
      - Cosmonaut’s bot checks via rest end points and RPC end points to see if a certain channel has any packets - if those packets are there for like 30 minutes, it sends a ping on Discord and can add tags to those channels e.g., if a packet is stuck on the Osmosis this path you will get notified
      - With Blackbox, you can say “I'm sending this request and I expect this kind of response” so you can create more advanced like responses 

- Passage focus in 2025
  - Bringing Passage to events, especially crypto events that have already kind the vision of what Passage is trying to create
  - Using Passage for side events as a way for event organizers to expand their event’s reach at little to no cost to and create a really engaging experience
  - Oportunity to bring in sponsors for Passage side events and be able to get all their costs covered
  - What the team is seeing with current users of Passage
    - They want to use it because of the high fidelity experience
    - They want to take advantage of the gamification elements that you can bring into a Passage World
    - They want to be able to use NFTs
  - In talking to event organizers, the reason they put together some of these events in specific locations is the goal of drawing attention to local talent - but people may overlook events in certain regions just simply because it's in an unfamiliar region and the local talent is subsequently overlooked
    - Passage events would provide an opportunity to draw attention tot hose areas and allow anyone to get involved even if they did not fly out to the in person event
